## JUnit Testing

### Testing vs Unit Testing
Testing:
  - Done post development.
  - Done by Test engineers
Unit Testing
  - Done by software developers itself, that have developed the code.

One unit is referring to one method of a class/group of methods/group of classes.
So, first we write a test. Based on this, we develop a unit. Then we run the test on the unit and see if it is passing or not, and modify accordingly.

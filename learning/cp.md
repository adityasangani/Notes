# GCD
- It is the same as HCF.
- ```GCD(a1,a2,a3,…,an)=GCD(a1,a1+a2,a1+a2+a3,…,a1+a2+a3+…+an)```

The proof for this is, let us assume d is the GCD of a1, a2, a3,..., an. 
Now, in the RHS, since d divides a1 and a2, it will also divide a1 + a2. 
Next, since d divides a1, a2, and a3, it will also divide a1 + a2 + a3, and so on. Hence proved.

# Factorization of a number
- We only need to go till the square root of that number. This is because if i is a divisor of x, then x/i is also a divisor of x.
